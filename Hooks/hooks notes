dont call hooks inside loops,conditions,nested functions
hooks can be used in functions only 
hooks cannot  be used in class

using usestate hook,state can be anything
when dealing with objects or arrays dont forget to use spread operator and then only call setter function

**lifecycle methods
constructor-function created whenever a new component is created
           -intialising state and binding event handlers and cannot make http request
props-directly overwrite this.state

**useeffect
